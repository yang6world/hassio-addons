    name: Voice
    description: >-
      The Piper voice to use. Voices are named according to the following
      scheme: `<language>-<name>-<quality>`.
  speaker:
    name: Speaker
    description: >-
      Speaker number to use if the voice supports multiple speakers.

  length_scale:
    name: Length scale
    description: >-
      Speeds up or slows down the voice. A value of 1.0 means to use the voice's
      default speaking rate, with < 1.0 being faster and > 1.0 being slower.
  noise_scale:
    name: Noise scale
    description: >-
      Controls the variability of audio by adding noise during audio generation.
      The effect highly depends on the voice itself, but in general a value of 0
      removes variability and values above 1 will start to degrade audio.
  noise_w:
    name: Speaking cadence
    description: >-
      Controls the variability of speaking cadence (phoneme widths). The effect
      highly depends on the voice itself, but in general a value of 0 removes
      variability and values above 1 produce extreme stutters and pauses.
