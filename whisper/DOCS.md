# Home Assistant Add-on: Whisper

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "Whisper" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

After this add-on is installed and running, it will be automatically discovered
by the Wyoming integration in Home Assistant. To finish the setup,
click the following my button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=wyoming)

Alternatively, you can install the Wyoming integration manually, see the
[Wyoming integration documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/)
for more information.

## Configuration

### Option: `language`

Default language for the add-on. In Home Assist 2023.8+, multiple languages can be used simultaneously by different [Assist pipelines](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant/).

If you select "auto", the model will run **much** slower but will auto-detect the spoken language.

### Option: `model`

Whisper model that will be used for transcription.

The default model is `tiny-int8`, a compressed version of the smallest Whisper model which is able to run on a Raspberry Pi 4.
Compressed models (`int8`) are slightly less accurate than their counterparts, but smaller and faster.

Available models are sorted from least to most accurate.

- `tiny-int8` (43 MB)
- `tiny` (152 MB)
- `base-int8` (80 MB)
- `base` (291 MB)
- `small-int8` (255 MB)
- `small` (968 MB)
- `medium-int8` (786 MB)

### Option: `beam_size`

Number of candidates to consider simultaneously during transcription (see [beam search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search)).

Increasing the beam size will increase accuracy at the cost of performance.

## Backups

Whisper model files can be quite large, so they are automatically excluded from backups. The models will be re-downloaded when the backup is restored.
