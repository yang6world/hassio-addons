[Genie] provides a complete solution to turn your Home Assistant
into a smart speaker. It supports playing music, controlling your
IoT, checking the weather, and other simple questions.

To use Genie as a voice assistant, you should connect a microphone and speaker to the
device where Home Assistant is installed, or you should provision
a Genie client in a separate smart-speaker device that connects to the
add-on. See the [installation-guide](https://wiki.genie.stanford.edu/getting-started/installation-guide)
for further details.
